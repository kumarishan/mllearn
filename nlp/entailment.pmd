## Textual Entailment
To categorize an ordered pair of sentences into three categories
- positive entailment - when you can use the first sentence to prove
  that a second sentence is true
- negative entailment - when the first sentence can be used to
  disprove the second sentence
- neutral entailment - if the two sentences have no correlation

Eg usages
- question-answering systems may use textual entailment to verify an
  answer from stored information.
- Textual entailment may also enhance document summarization by
  filtering out sentences that donâ€™t include new information

A direcUonal relation between two text fragments:
Text (t) and Hypothesis (h)

t entails h ($t \Rightarrow h$) if
humans reading t will infer that h is most likely true
